# Astronomer Airflow DAG Authoring Study Guide
In this repository we are going to explore the content required on the Airflow DAG Authoring Certification exam from Astronomer. The approach is to use the current README file as a guide for exploring the subjects, and also structure a repository to deploy Airflow locally to test core features.

## 1. Installing Docker
One of the easiest ways to deploy Airflow is through Docker containers. To do it, we first need to install Docker and Docker Compose.
